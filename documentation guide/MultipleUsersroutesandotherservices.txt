=>Create new route with new file name then change in app/providers/RouteServiceProvider.php



For Example To add trainer module
add middleware with class name then add to kernel.php and assign class then add all web class used in kernel.php at the top and create same new one with your middleware name.
and guard to middleware class
and define route and prefix in app/providers/RouteServiceProvider.php




Example Reference : https://imrealashu.in/code/laravel/multi-auth-with-laravel-5-2-2/




Important files need to change for multi auth
middleware create and add to kernel.php with new auth name
providers-> RouteServiceProvider.php  changes
route folder add new route for it
config/auth.php add changes
then every time auth login add guard with it => example Auth:guard('trainer')->attempt ---for login attempt and for user info Auth::guard('trainer')->user();
